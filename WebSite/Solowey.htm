        <p>
            If the true measure of a person's life is the imprint they leave on the lives of others, Nicholas Solowey's life powerfully stamped the lives of countless people providing the guiding integrity and boundless support for numerous NJ Little League District 1 leagues, members and most of all, his crew of dedicated volunteer Little League umpires
        </p>
        <p>
            On Friday, July 19, 2019 Nick passed on in the loving comfort of his longtime Stanhope home, surrounded by his family.  For over 50 years, Nick supported NJ Little League District 1 in every way possible helping to create and support countless opportunities for the baseball and softball players in the greater Morris County area.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nick was born on July 22, 1929.  He resided in Stanhope, NJ and he is survived by his beloved wife of 36 years, Debbie Hart Solowey; two devoted children, John Solowey and wife Marjorie, and Michelle Roberts and husband Ronald; two cherished grandchildren, Nicholas and Alexandria Roberts; and by many other loving family members and friends. He owned and operated Hart Personnel in Parsippany with his wife Debbie years and was often the location of many Little League meetings and events.
        </p>
        <p>
            His Little League activities began over 50 years ago, initially as President of Denville Little League, Little League umpire and for over 25 years District Administrator of NJ District 1. Right up until this year, he proudly led and supported the efforts of NJ District 1 as Treasurer. He'd always said one of proudest moments was the opportunity to umpire the Senior League World Series.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifically, his support of NJD1's volunteer umpires and the high regard in which he was held by Little League East Region led to 13 of them being selected for various level Little League World Series assignments with two of them, Jack Conway (1996) and Tom Reynolds (2015) being selected for the pinnacle umpiring honor in Little League, working the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nick's guidance over the years helped all the leagues of NJ Little League District 1 provide baseball and softball for thousands of children in the greater Morris County area.  He helped and supported each and every one of them manage the complexities of running their leagues, providing counsel and guidance to provide the very best experience for all their players, managers, coaches and volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The NJ Little League District 1 family would like to extend its deepest condolences to his wife Debbie and the whole Solowey family.  Nick guided us, supported us and provided us with opportunities in Little League that we all truly cherish.  His grace, integrity and smile will be dearly missed by us all.
        </p>
        <p>
